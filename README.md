# YouTube Downloader
A very simple program to automatically download videos and playlists from youtube.

The program is console based currently. If you want to run the source code instead of the exe then the "yt_dlp" package will need to be installed via pip.

## Info
The video/playlist needs to be either public or unlisted, otherwise the program will not be able to retrieve the it from YT.

After entering the URL you can chose to download the video(w/ audio) or only audio. Both are downloaded in the mp4 format.

Downloaded videos have their names copied from youtube and are saved in a new folder called downloads in the current directory.
