# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The newest version only will be updates with security updates. Check the releases page for the newest version available

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilitues please create an issue on this repo or use the github security page and send it thought there (i dont care if the info for the dropdowns is incorrect, as long as the vulnerability is writen somewhere).
Generally I'll fix vulnerabilities within a week of being alerted to them, if its particularly difficult it may take longer. Updated windows exe's I release slower, yet they will be updated depending on the severity and when I have the time.
